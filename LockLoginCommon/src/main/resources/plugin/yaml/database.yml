#Database connection utilities
#
# Name:               The database name, for SQLite this will be the sqlite file name (without extensions)
# Host:               Useless in SQLite. Database host, usually an IP address (127.0.0.1)
# Port:               Useless in SQLite. It indicates the port where your sql server is hosted on
# User:               The user that should have access to the database
# Pass:               The user password, if any (recommended)
# UseSSL:             If the connection to the host is performed under SSL. Usually not needed as most
#                     servers use the same server as the SQL server. But if that's not the case, it's
#                     highly recommended to enable and configure this setting
# IgnoreCertificates: If the connection should ignore server certificates, usually needed in tests
#                     environments, but not recommended on production

#Tables configuration. LockLogin allows to modify
#every table row. This helps you to add compatibility
#with a CMS if you have any.
#
# To make LockLogin work with any CMS, just make LockLogin use
# the same fields your CMS uses. Also don't forget to make the
# plugin and your CMS use the same hashing algorithm with the
# same configuration.
