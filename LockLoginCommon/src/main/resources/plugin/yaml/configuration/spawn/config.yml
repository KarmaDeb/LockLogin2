# Delay   -> The time in seconds to take before sending
#            the player to the spawn
# Cancel  -> The cancel rule set for which the spawn
#            should be cancelled

#Manages the spawn "take me back" function
#
# This will work regardless of main "Enabled" setting, as
# this is actually if the player should be sent to his last
# logout location after a successful login
#
# Enabled -> Enables or disables the "take me back" function
# Distance -> The minimum distance the client must be from spawn
#             in order to actually save his last location. This prevents

#             store his latest location at spawn location
