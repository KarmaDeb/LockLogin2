#Movement configuration
#
# Allow: allow movement
#
# Method: The method to deny movement if allow is set to false.
#         Valid methods are: 'speed' and 'teleport'. Speed works
#         by setting the client walk and fly speed to 0, meanwhile
#         teleport will just teleport the client back
#
# Distance: The maximum distance to allow the client to move if
#           movement is allowed. Please note, leaving this value to zero
#           will allow the player to move freely, which is not recommended
Movement:
  Allow: false
  Method: 'teleport'
  Distance: 10

#Permissions configuration
#
# BlockOperator: If true, and a player had operator. The plugin will remove from him even after a successful login
# RemoveEverything: If true, all the permissions from player will be taken, unless he is successful login
# AllowWildcard: If false, and a player had the permission '*'. The plugin will remove from him even after a successful login
# UnLogged: The permissions to grant to non-logged clients. Those will be removed after a successfull login
# Logged:  The permission to grant to logged clients. Those will be removed after the client session gets closed
#
# Why you shouldn't allow OP?
#   OP is literally pointless when having a permission plugin, unless required, OP shouldn't be granted to
#   anyone, including server owners. If required, the correct would be grant op, do the needed tasks, and
#   remove op.
#
# Why you shouldn't allow '*' wildcard?
#   There's no problem when used in a plugin permission (example: locklogin.*), the problem is when you use it as a
#   single permission. It grants you all the permissions (including op). Meaning you can do whatever you want. The
#   correct permission policy would be that one that only allows permission managing from console, and only the
#   required permission should be granted to staff members (ban, kick, warn...). WorldEdit or massive world editor
#   plugin permissions should aso be separated in another world/server
Permissions:
  BlockOperator: true
  RemoveEverything: true
  AllowWildcard: false
  PreLogin:

#Password configuration
#
# PrintSuccess: When warn unsafe is enabled, print success checks in green to the player
# BlockUnsafe: Block unsafe passwords
# WarnUnsafe: If true, all staff members with the permission
#             locklogin.unsafe.warning will receive a message about the player used an unsafe password.
#             If a discord webhook is also configured, a discord message will be also sent (A warning will
#             be sent to staff only if BlockUnsafe is disabled)
# IgnoreCommon: Ignore the list of common passwords when checking the password.
#
# Safety: Password general safety setting (Leave everything to 0 to disable)
#   MinLength: The password minimum length, will be override if other password policy characters are more than
#              the min length. For example, setting min lower letters to 10, and having min length to 6, will
#              make min length be 10
#
#   Characters: The minimum amount of special characters needed in the password (Leave to 0 to disable)
#   Numbers: The minimum amount of numbers needed in the password (Leave to 0 to disable)
#   Letters: The minimum amount of letters
#     Upper: The minimum amount of upper case letters needed in the password (Leave to 0 to disable)
#     Lower: The minimum amount of lower case letters needed in the password (Leave to 0 to disable)
